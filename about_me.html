      <p>
        my name is Hanasato Minori! I'm a young student and recent idol in the group More More
        Jump, in which I'm fortunate enough to be able to perform right next to Haruka-chan!!

      <h1>About me (no but for real)</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Aisling Fontaine, I am a project sekai player that also happens to have
        done a bit of web dev a few years back. When I discovered nekoweb in 2024, I thought
        it would be a fun way to bring back this passion of mine by mixing it with one 
        of my current interests, the aforementioned rythm game!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, I like to pretend I'm one of the characters, Minori Hanasato, who is the biggest
        fan of long-time idol Haruka Kiritani, creating a whole website to show her appreciation
        to her.
